# Server Operators
* Allows members to administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges
* Members of the Server Operators group typically have permissions to perform tasks such as restart/shut down domain controller, managing shared resources, managing services, managing printer queues
* Very high privileged group that can log in locally to servers
* Members are granted the `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege` and the ability to control local services

## Querying the AppReadiness Service

### AppReadiness Service
* Ensure that applications are ready for use on Windows systems
* It handles various tasks related to the installation, update, and removal of applications, ensuring they are prepared and configured correctly for use

<pre>C:\htb> sc qc AppReadiness

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS

## Checking Service Permissions with PsService
* Use the service viewer/controller **PsService** which is part of the Sysinternals suite - to check permissions on the service
* **PsService** is similar to **sc** utility and can display service status and configurations - also allows you to start/stop/resume/pause/restart services both locally and remote
